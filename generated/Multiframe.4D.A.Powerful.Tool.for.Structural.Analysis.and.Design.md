# Multiframe 4D: A Powerful Tool for Structural Analysis and Design
 
Multiframe 4D is a suite of software that works the way structural engineers do. It allows you to build and analyse 3D models of framed structures, and perform dynamic analysis using modal or time history methods. Multiframe 4D is suitable for static and dynamic analysis of buildings, bridges, towers, cranes, offshore platforms, and other structures. It also provides design checks for steel sections according to various codes.

## Features and Benefits of Multiframe 4D
 
Multiframe 4D has many features that make it a powerful and easy to use tool for structural analysis and design. Some of these features are:
 
- Graphical user interface that lets you create and edit models using mouse clicks and drag-and-drop operations.
- Fast and accurate solver that uses sub-space iteration to find the natural modes, frequencies, and periods of your structures.
- Time history analysis that allows you to simulate the structure's response to seismic or other dynamic loading over time.
- Built-in library of earthquake spectra and customisable force and acceleration database.
- Master-slave joint linking, prescribed displacements, springs, thermal effects, offset members, additional masses, and other advanced modelling options.
- Animation of mode shapes and time history response, including QuickTime support.
- Design checks for steel sections according to various codes, such as AISC, ASCE, BS5950, Eurocode 3, etc.
- Smooth integration with Excel, AutoCAD, and other Windows programs.

## How to Download Multiframe 4D for Free Using Torrent
 
If you want to try Multiframe 4D for yourself, you can download it for free using a torrent link. A torrent is a file that contains information about other files that are distributed over a peer-to-peer network. You need a torrent client software to download the files using the torrent link. One of the most popular torrent clients is uTorrent, which you can download from [https://www.utorrent.com/](https://www.utorrent.com/).
 
Once you have installed uTorrent on your computer, you can use the following torrent link to download Multiframe 4D:
